# AfroPix-Project
comprehensive education application on DEI intiatives
This project explores the relationship between diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies and business performance, with a particular focus on Black-owned businesses. By analyzing data from industry reports, including McKinsey & Companyâ€™s Diversity Wins, Harvard Business Review studies, and EEOC diversity reports, we aim to present a data-driven comparison of companies that actively implement DEI initiatives versus those that do not.
